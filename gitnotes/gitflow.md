# What is Git?
Git is a version control system that records changes to a file or set of files over time. Version control systems allow developers to:
* Revert the entire project back with the use of snapshots,
* Compare file changes
* See user's last modification
* See who/when and issue was introduced
* Easy file recovery in case of errors or emergencies
## Note:
Nothing beats reading the manual. So if you want to, Gits documentation can be found here:
https://git-scm.com/doc
